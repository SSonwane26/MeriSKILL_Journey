## About Projects
### Project One
[DASHBOARD](https://github.com/SSonwane26/MeriSKILL_Journey/blob/main/Project1.png)

**Cleaninig and Modeling the Data:**

For this project, we performed data analysis using Excel, utilizing Power Query. Here are the steps we followed:

1. Data Loading: We loaded the data using Power Query, which is a data transformation tool in Excel.

2. Column Headers: We promoted headers to ensure the data columns were appropriately labeled.

3. Column Selection: Unwanted columns were removed from the dataset to streamline the analysis.

4. New Columns: We inserted additional columns into the dataset, enhancing its usability:

   a. Week of Year: A new column was created using the 'Order Date' column to represent the week of the year for each order.

   b. City: Another new column was added, extracting the city information from the 'Purchase Address' column.

   c. Sales: We introduced a 'Sales' column by combining data from the 'Quantity' and 'Price' columns to calculate the total sales for each order.

**Creating Dashboard:**

After preprocessing the data, the sales data was loaded into a Pivot Table, and various Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and charts were created. Here are the steps and components:

1. Pivot Table: A Pivot Table was generated using the sales data.

2. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
   - Revenue: Calculated the total revenue from the sales data.
   - Total Orders: Determined the count of total orders.
   - Total Products: Counted the total number of unique products.
   - Monthly Sales: Created a column chart to visualize sales on a monthly basis.
   - Weekly Sales: Generated an area chart to visualize sales on a weekly basis.
   - Regionwise Sales: Presented region-wise sales using a bar chart.
   - Top Products by Sales: Displayed the top products by sales using another bar chart.

3. Slicers:
   - Region Slicer: Implemented a slicer to filter data by region.
   - Month Slicer: Included a slicer to filter data by month.

These steps and components help to analyze and visualize the sales data effectively.

**Insights:**

Here are the key insights from the data analysis:

1. Revenue: The total revenue is $34.49 million.

2. Total Orders: There are a total of 185,950 orders.

3. Total Unique Products: There are 19 unique products in the dataset.

4. Most Sales Months: The months of October, November, and December have the highest sales, with Quarter Four being a high sales quarter, likely due to festivals and vacation seasons.

5. Weekly Sales: Weeks 39 to 53 of the year show higher sales.

6. Regional Revenue: San Francisco contributes the most revenue, followed by Los Angeles (LA) and New York (NY).

7. Top Products by Sales: The top-selling products are MacBook, iPhone, and ThinkPad.

8. Slicer Example: Using slicers, you can see that in the Austin region, the total revenue in the month of April is $0.17 million.

These insights provide a clear understanding of the sales performance and trends in the dataset, allowing for informed decision-making and further analysis.

We have successfully completed our first project, gaining valuable insights into the workings of the sales industry and how past data can be used to predict future sales. Additionally, we have acquired the skill of designing attractive and informative dashboards.
